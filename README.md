Quantum Resilient Encryption
# Trageser Quantum-Proof Encryption

A Python implementation of the Trageser Framework for quantum-proof encryption, leveraging the Trageser Transformation Theorem (TTT), Phi, 3-6-9-7, Giza Pyramid mathematics, Fibonacci, and an 18D adaptive multi-lattice. Developed by James Trageser.

## Features
- TTT and TST for sequence transformations.
- Supports Fibonacci, sqrt(n), and chaotic sequences.
- 18D lattice with Phi and 9 frequency bases (461333.337 Hz, etc.).
- Adaptive dimension scaling (9D to 18D).
- Quantum-resistant encryption/decryption.
- Handles large numbers (e.g., 10^1998 Hz) with Decimal.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
