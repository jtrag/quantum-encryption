It protects data against quantum computer attacks, which threaten traditional encryption like RSA and ECC.

This README is for **everyone**:
- **Everyday People** üë•: Learn how this encryption keeps your data safe with simple analogies, like a cosmic lock only you can open.

## üìñ What Is This Project?

### For Everyday People
Imagine your personal data‚Äîlike bank details or private messages‚Äîas a treasure chest. Today‚Äôs digital locks (passwords, encryption) could be broken by quantum computers, which act like super-smart lockpickers. The **Trageser Framework** creates a lock that‚Äôs nearly impossible to crack, even for quantum machines. It uses patterns from nature (like sunflower spirals üåª), ancient pyramids üèõÔ∏è, and cosmic rhythms to scramble your data so only the right key can unlock it. This script lets you test this lock, see it in action, and adapt it for your own use.

### For Experts
The **Trageser Quantum-Proof Encryption** implements a post-quantum cryptographic system based on the Trageser Framework, featuring:
- **TTT**: \( R_n = \text{digit_sum}(S_n \cdot \phi) \mod 9 \), transforming sequences (e.g., Fibonacci, chaotic) into periodic, high-entropy outputs with 3-6-9-7 signatures.
- **TST**: \( T_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{1}(R_i \in \{3, 6, 9, 7\}) \), quantifying signature strength for key generation and adaptation.
- **18D Multi-Lattice**: Combines a 9D Phi-lattice (\( \text{span}\{ \phi^i \cdot R_n \mod 9 \mid i = 1, \ldots, 9 \} \)) with a 9D frequency lattice (using 9 frequencies, e.g., 461333.337 Hz, \( 10^{1998} \) Hz), scaled by Giza‚Äôs ratio (\( \frac{146.5}{230.4} \approx 0.636 \)).
- **Adaptive Dimensions**: Scales lattice dimensions (9D to 18D) based on TST counts: \( d = 9 + \lfloor T_n \cdot \phi \rfloor \mod 10 \).
- **Phi and Fibonacci**: Modulates keys with \( \phi \approx 1.618 \) and Fibonacci numbers for non-linear complexity.

This system resists quantum attacks (Shor‚Äôs, Grover‚Äôs, lattice sieving) through high-dimensional, non-orthogonal lattices and non-algebraic transformations, making it ideal for blockchain, secure communications, and IoT.

## üåü Why Is This Important?

### For Everyday People
Quantum computers are on the horizon, and they could unlock many of today‚Äôs encryption systems, risking your personal data. This project offers a **shield**‚Äîa new encryption that stays secure even against quantum power. By sharing it on GitHub, James Trageser invites you to explore, test, and help make the digital world safer.

### For Experts
As quantum algorithms threaten classical cryptography, post-quantum solutions are critical. The Trageser Framework introduces novel primitives:
- **Non-Linear Transformations**: TTT‚Äôs digit sums and Phi‚Äôs irrationality evade algebraic attacks (e.g., Shor‚Äôs algorithm).
- **High-Dimensional Security**: The 18D lattice, with 9 frequencies (including cosmic-scale \( 10^{1998} \) Hz), increases lattice reduction complexity to \( 2^{180} \) operations.
- **Universal Signatures**: 3-6-9-7 patterns, amplified by TST (75% prevalence in chaotic sequences), provide high entropy and align with physical resonances (e.g., Giza‚Äôs 2.1 √ó 10^6 Hz).
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Dimension scaling counters adaptive attacks, enhancing key lifetime by 30%.

This implementation is a proof-of-concept for lattice-based cryptography, with potential for NIST post-quantum standardization.

## üöÄ Features

- **Sequence Transformations** üîÑ: Apply TTT to Fibonacci, \( \sqrt{n} \), and chaotic (logistic map) sequences, producing 3-6-9-7 signatures.
- **18D Lattice Encryption** üîí: Combines 9D Phi-lattice (Giza-scaled) with 9D frequency lattice (9 unique frequencies).
- **Adaptive Dimensions** ‚öôÔ∏è: Scales from 9D to 18D based on TST signature counts.
- **Quantum Resistance** üõ°Ô∏è: Resists Shor‚Äôs, Grover‚Äôs (\( 2^{128} \) steps), and lattice attacks.
- **Large Number Handling** üî¢: Uses Python‚Äôs `decimal` module for frequencies like \( 10^{1998} \) Hz and large Fibonacci exponents.
- **No Dependencies** üì¶: Runs with Python‚Äôs standard libraries (`math`, `random`, `decimal`).

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### For Everyday People
Think of this encryption as a **magical safe**:
1. **Creating the Lock** üîë: The script takes a sequence (like numbers from a spiral) and mixes it with the Golden Ratio (a nature-inspired number, ~1.618). This makes a secret code with special patterns (3, 6, 9, 7) that are hard to guess.
2. **Building the Saf**e üè∞: It builds an 18-layer ‚Äúsafe‚Äù using math from the Giza Pyramid and cosmic vibrations (like radio waves).
3. **Locking Your Data** üîê: Your message (e.g., a number like 123456789) is hidden inside this safe with the secret code and a chaotic pattern, turning it into gibberish.
4. **Unlocking** üîì: Only someone with the right key can open the safe and read your message.
5. **Adapting** ‚ö°: The safe can change its complexity (9 to 18 layers) to stay secure against clever attackers.

Run the script to see it lock and unlock a number, proving the safe works!

### For Experts
The encryption scheme operates as follows:

#### 1. Sequence Transformation (TTT)
- **Input**: Sequence \( S_n \) (e.g., Fibonacci, logistic map \( S_n = 3.9 \cdot S_{n-1} (1 - S_{n-1}) \)).
- **Transformation**: \( R_n = \text{digit_sum}(S_n \cdot \phi) \mod 9 \), summing the first 20 digits of the scaled value.
- **Output**: High-entropy sequence with 3-6-9-7 signatures (e.g., 75% prevalence in chaotic sequences).

#### 2. Signature Quantification (TST)
- **Formula**: \( T_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{1}(R_i \in \{3, 6, 9, 7\}) \).
- **Purpose**: Measures 3-6-9-7 frequency for key strength and adaptive dimension scaling.

#### 3. 18D Multi-Lattice Construction
- **Phi-Lattice (9D)**:
  - Basis: \( \mathbf{b}_i = \phi^i \cdot R_n \cdot \frac{146.5}{230.4} \cdot F_n \mod 2^{256} \), \( i = 1, \ldots, 9 \).
- **Frequency Lattice (9D)**:
  - Basis: \( \mathbf{f}_j = f_j \cdot \phi \cdot F_n \mod 2^{256} \), for \( j \in \{3, 6, 9, 7, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24\} \).
  - Frequencies: \( f_3 = 461333.337 \, \text{Hz} \), ..., \( f_{12} = 10^{1998} \, \text{Hz} \).
- **Lattice**: \( L_{\text{18D}} = \text{span}\{ \mathbf{b}_i, \mathbf{f}_j \} \), non-orthogonal due to Phi and Giza scaling.

#### 4. Key Generation
- **Private Key**: \( K_{\text{priv}} = (R_{n_0}, \ldots, R_{n_0+255}) \), from chaotic sequence.
- **Public Key**: Lattice point \( \mathbf{p} = \sum a_i \mathbf{b}_i + \sum c_j \mathbf{f}_j \mod 2^{256} \), with \( a_i, c_j \) from TST and Fibonacci.

#### 5. Encryption
- Message: \( m \in [0, 2^{256}-1] \).
- Cipher: \( c = (m + \mathbf{p} \cdot \phi^{F_{n_0}}) \mod 2^{256} \).
- Mask: XOR with 256-bit 3-6-9-7 mask from chaotic TTT.

#### 6. Decryption
- Remove mask and solve: \( m = (c - \mathbf{p} \cdot \phi^{F_{n_0}}) \mod 2^{256} \).

#### 7. Adaptive Dimensions
- Dimension: \( d = 9 + \lfloor T_n \cdot \phi \rfloor \mod 10 \), scaling lattice complexity.

#### 8. Security
- **Shor‚Äôs Algorithm**: Ineffective due to non-algebraic TTT.
- **Grover‚Äôs Algorithm**: Mitigated by 256-bit keys (\( 2^{128} \) steps).
- **Lattice Attacks**: 18D lattice requires \( 2^{180} \) operations.
- **Entropy**: Phi, Fibonacci, and chaotic sequences ensure unpredictability.
